🍱 miso-sampler 
====================

This project contains a sample [miso](https://github.com/dmjio/miso) application with scripts to 
develop against vanilla GHC and to compile to Web Assembly or JavaScript.

### Source

View [source](https://github.com/haskell-miso/miso-sampler/blob/main/app/Main.hs).

### Install Nix (w/ flakes enabled)

```bash
# Install nix 
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh

# Enable flakes
echo 'experimental-features = nix-command flakes' >> ~/.config/nix/nix.conf
```

> [!TIP] 
> Miso requires installing [nix](https://nixos.org) with [Nix Flakes](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes) enabled.

### Browser mode 🔥

For interactive development in the browser via the WASM backend

```bash
$ nix develop .#wasm --command bash -c 'make repl'
```

```
Preprocessing executable 'app' for app-0.1.0.0...
GHCi, version 9.12.2.20250924: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/main.html or import http://127.0.0.1:8080/main.js to boot ghci
```

Paste the URL in your browser. Doing so will cause assets to transfer; you can inspect the network tab, but do not refresh the page. The REPL will load in the terminal

```
Loaded GHCi configuration from /Users/dmjio/Desktop/miso-sampler/.ghci
[1 of 2] Compiling Main             ( app/Main.hs, interpreted )
Ok, one module loaded.
ghci>
```

Finally, to run the example app, run `main` in the `repl`:

```
ghci> main
```

and you will see

Call `:r` to refresh the page with the latest code. Using `Miso.Run.reload` (as shown below) ensures the `<body>` and `<head>` are cleared between reloads.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = reload defaultEvents app
```

### Live reload 🔥

If you use [ghciwatch](https://github.com/MercuryTechnologies/ghciwatch) you can have live reload functionality (where `main` is executed whenever a file is saved to disk).

When combined with the `live` function it is possible to persist the application state between GHCi reloads. This is like `reload`, except your application state will not be cleared.

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = live defaultEvents app
```

See the [Miso.Reload](https://haddocks.haskell-miso.org/miso/Miso-Reload.html) haddocks for more information.

```bash
$ nix develop .#wasm --command bash -c 'make watch'
```

### Development

Call `nix develop` to enter a shell with [GHC 9.12.2](https://haskell.org/ghc)

```bash
$ nix develop .#wasm
```

Once in the shell, you can call `cabal run` to start the development server and view the application at http://localhost:8080

### Build (Web Assembly)

```bash
$ nix develop .#wasm --command bash -c "make"
```

### Build (JavaScript)

```bash
$ nix develop .#ghcjs --command bash -c "make js"
```

### Serve

To host the built application you can call `serve`

```bash
$ nix develop --command bash -c "make serve"
```

### Clean

```bash
$ nix develop --command bash -c "make clean"
```

### CI

Ensure that the Haskell miso [cachix](cachix.org) is being used when building your own projects in CI

```yaml
- name: Install cachix
  uses: cachix/cachix-action@v16
  with:
    name: haskell-miso-cachix
```

### Hosting

To upload and host your project to Github Pages, please see [our Github workflow file](https://github.com/haskell-miso/miso-sampler/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml#L38-L56) and the necessary Github actions included.
